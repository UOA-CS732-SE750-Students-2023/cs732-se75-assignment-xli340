There are two project folders here, demo0-by-javascript and demo1-by-typscript.
Both projects are versions from the beginning of the video presentation.
After using the git clone command to clone the project, you need to execute `npm install` in the project path to complete the installation of related dependencies.
Then execute the command `npm run dev` to access the relevant page under the address link prompted in the terminal.
For example, to execute the project demo0-by-javascript written in JavaScript, you need to enter the path /demo0-by-javascript/ to complete the above operations.

Here, demo0-by-javascript is developed by JavaScript. When you enter two numbers on the page and click Add, you will get the result of splicing the two numbers.
In the video I entered 1 and 2 and the result is 12.
And demo1-by-typescript is developed by TypeScript. When you enter two numbers on the page and click Add, you get the sum of the two numbers.
In the video I input 1 and 2 and the result is 3.
You can try to follow the operation of the video to experience related features of TypeScript, such as the feature of auto import.
You can also use TypeScript to add other functionality to your project, such as a to-do-list in LAB.
Hope you fall in love with TypeScript.

Here I attach some TypeScript learning links, I will be very happy if it is helpful to you.
